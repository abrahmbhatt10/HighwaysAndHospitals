| September 9 |  5-5:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                   I brainstormed possible code. |
| September 9 | 5:30-6:00pm |                                                                                                                                                   I tried using a math formula. |
| September 9 | 6:00-6:30pm |                                                                                                                           The formula worked, but only for the small test case. |
| September 9 |  6:30-7pm   |                                                                                                                                        I tried to brainstorm new possibilities. |
| September 9 |  7-7:30pm   |                                                                            I contemplated using Breadth First Search, but decided to wait until more clues were given in class. |
| September 9 |  7:30-8pm   |  I thought that this problem set has two dice roll set, one in which there was a hospital or not in a city, whether there was a highway, no high way, or whether it was costly. |
