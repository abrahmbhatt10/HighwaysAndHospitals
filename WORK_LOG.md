| September 9  |   5-5:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                               I brainstormed possible code. |
| September 9  |  5:30-6:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                               I tried using a math formula. |
| September 9  |  6:00-6:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                       The formula worked, but only for the small test case. |
| September 9  |   6:30-7pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                    I tried to brainstorm new possibilities. |
| September 9  |   7-7:30pm    |                                                                                                                                        I contemplated using Breadth First Search, but decided to wait until more clues were given in class. |
| September 9  |   7:30-8pm    |                                                              I thought that this problem set has two dice roll set, one in which there was a hospital or not in a city, whether there was a highway, no high way, or whether it was costly. |
| September 10 |   5-5:30pm    |                                                                                            I thought of using an arraylist to figure out which cities are clustered with which other cities, and putting each cluster in its own arraylist. |
| September 10 |   5:30-6pm    |                              I realized that this method may have a few limitations, because just because one city may not connect to the other cities, it could still be connected to a 3rd city which is connected to those other cities. |
| September 10 |   6-6:30pm    |                                                                                          I realized that just because one city isn't directly connected to others within the same cluster does not mean that it isn't indirectly connected. |
| September 10 |   6:30-7pm    |                                                                                                                                                                             I realized that for loops were taking too much processing time. |
| September 11 |  6 - 6:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                   I implemented hashmap and sorting of hashmap by values to find most connected city nodes. |
| September 11 |   8-8:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                         I was able to pass the small/small efficient tests. |
| September 11 |   8:30-9pm    |                                                                                                                   The large test was failing. It was because I was searching for all the cities from 1 to n, to see if they were connected. |
| September 12 |    3:30-4     |                                                                                                                                           I revised the for loops to focus on the data in the cities array which is smaller than the n set. |
| September 12 |    4-4:30     |                                              I added code to check for a subgroup. I did this so that I could determine whether or not hospital is cheaper or adding highways for all nodes is cheaper. One large set also started passing. |
| September 13 |   5-5:30pm    |                                                                                                       I finished coding some of the initial aspects of the algorithm, like checking for the case where hospitals are cheaper than highways. |
| September 13 |   5:30-6 pm   |                                                                                                                                                              Unfortunately, I couldn't find any ideas for storing the subRoots in an array. |
| September 13 |   6-6:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                  I tried brainstorming a bit further, but to not much luck. |
| September 13 | 6:30 - 7:00pm |                                                                                                          I thought that maybe I could create a subRoot or parent variable, and have a while loop to figure out the final root in a cluster. |
| September 13 |   7:30-8pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                      I tried running, but it kept giving me error messages. |
| September 13 |   8-8:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                         I tried debugging it further, but to not much luck. |
| September 13 |  8:30 - 9pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I was still debugging. |
| September 13 |  9 - 9:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                               I tried various casting techniques, but it still gave me an overflow message. |
| September 13 | 9:30-10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                While I was coding, I thought I could use some of the code from my first attempt to help me. |
| September 13 | 10:00-10:30pm |                                                                                                                                            I was trying to use the try method to handle to overflow error, but even then, to not much luck. |
| September 13 |  10:30-11pm   |                                                                                                                     I think at some point in this timeframe I thought of what Josh said in class today, about casting everything to a long. |
| September 13 |  11-11:30pm   | I realized that the overflow message was because I hadn't cast it to a long, which was why the integer storage size couldn't handle the amount of memory needed to store a long variable, which was why it was giving the overflow message. |
| September 13 | 11:30pm-12am  |                                                                                                                                                    I spent time trying to make it more convenient/faster, and writing my work log/comments. |
