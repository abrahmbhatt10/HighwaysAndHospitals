| September 9  |  5-5:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                  I brainstormed possible code. |
| September 9  | 5:30-6:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                  I tried using a math formula. |
| September 9  | 6:00-6:30pm |                                                                                                                                                          The formula worked, but only for the small test case. |
| September 9  |  6:30-7pm   |                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to brainstorm new possibilities. |
| September 9  |  7-7:30pm   |                                                                                                           I contemplated using Breadth First Search, but decided to wait until more clues were given in class. |
| September 9  |  7:30-8pm   |                                 I thought that this problem set has two dice roll set, one in which there was a hospital or not in a city, whether there was a highway, no high way, or whether it was costly. |
| September 10 |  5-5:30pm   |                                                               I thought of using an arraylist to figure out which cities are clustered with which other cities, and putting each cluster in its own arraylist. |
| September 10 |  5:30-6pm   | I realized that this method may have a few limitations, because just because one city may not connect to the other cities, it could still be connected to a 3rd city which is connected to those other cities. |
| September 10 |  6-6:30pm   |                                                             I realized that just because one city isn't directly connected to others within the same cluster does not mean that it isn't indirectly connected. |
| September 10 |  6:30-7pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                              I |
