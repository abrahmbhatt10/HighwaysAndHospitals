| September 9  |  5-5:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                  I brainstormed possible code. |
| September 9  | 5:30-6:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                  I tried using a math formula. |
| September 9  | 6:00-6:30pm |                                                                                                                                                          The formula worked, but only for the small test case. |
| September 9  |  6:30-7pm   |                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to brainstorm new possibilities. |
| September 9  |  7-7:30pm   |                                                                                                           I contemplated using Breadth First Search, but decided to wait until more clues were given in class. |
| September 9  |  7:30-8pm   |                                 I thought that this problem set has two dice roll set, one in which there was a hospital or not in a city, whether there was a highway, no high way, or whether it was costly. |
| September 10 |  5-5:30pm   |                                                               I thought of using an arraylist to figure out which cities are clustered with which other cities, and putting each cluster in its own arraylist. |
| September 10 |  5:30-6pm   | I realized that this method may have a few limitations, because just because one city may not connect to the other cities, it could still be connected to a 3rd city which is connected to those other cities. |
| September 10 |  6-6:30pm   |                                                             I realized that just because one city isn't directly connected to others within the same cluster does not mean that it isn't indirectly connected. |
| September 10 |  6:30-7pm   |                                                                                                                                                I realized that for loops were taking too much processing time. |
| September 11 | 6 - 6:30pm  |                                                                                                                      I implemented hashmap and sorting of hashmap by values to find most connected city nodes. |
| September 11 |  8-8:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                            I was able to pass the small/small efficient tests. |
| September 11 |  8:30-9pm   |                                                                                      The large test was failing. It was because I was searching for all the cities from 1 to n, to see if they were connected. |
| September 12 |   3:30-4    |                                                                                                              I revised the for loops to focus on the data in the cities array which is smaller than the n set. |
| September 12 |   4-4:30    |                 I added code to check for a subgroup. I did this so that I could determine whether or not hospital is cheaper or adding highways for all nodes is cheaper. One large set also started passing. |
